## What is shaduxe/ui?

Collection of variations built on top of shadcn/ui, designed to take your UI to the next level.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

***Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.***
